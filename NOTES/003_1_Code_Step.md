#### Intial styling
1. Clear browser defaults. 
```
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

2. Set background-color and color for entire app 
```
body {
    background-color: #fff;
    color: #555;
    font-family: 'Lato', 'Arial', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 300;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
